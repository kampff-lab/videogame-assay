### LEVEL 0 - HABITUATION  (20-30')

Habituation to the Videogame assay.
Red background and walls in place starting from this level.
NO ports tones present but ports activity monitored.


### LEVEL 1 - TRAINING  (about 45')

Food ports training.
Each port is associated with a tone called 'availability tone'. The rat needs to learn that when the tone is played the correspondent port could deliver a pellet if it pokes in it.
This level could present time out ot not (the availability tone plays .
Between trials there is an exponential delay (6000/3000 as start) which will be increased over the days to prevent the rat from staying in fron of the ports waiting for the reward.
Every time the rat sussessfully pokes into the port a reward tone is played and the reward delivered right after.


### LEVEL 2 - TOUCHING LIGHT  (about 45')

The rat needs to 'touch' a yellow circle (collision detected between 2 colliders = rat + circle) that appears in a random position on the floor, this event triggers the reward availability tone (one at the time or both).
The exp delay between trials remains 6000/3000.


### LEVEL 3 - MOVING LIGHT  (about 45')

The rat needs to touch the circle which will start moving away from it when reaching a set distance.
After the circle has been touched see LEVEL 2.
DAY 1 has the first 20 trials as LEVEL 2 (touching light) to be able to detect the unexpected moment in which the circle from static starts moving.
The next days the level start as LEVEL 3 since the beginning, the cicle always move away and bouncing against the walls. 
The exp delay between trials remains 6000/3000.


### LEVEL 4 - UNPREDICTABLE WORLD (about 45')

The circle can behave in different ways in a random fashion (static or moving).
After the circle has been touched see LEVEL 2.
The exp delay between trials remains 6000/3000.


### LEVEL 5 -- RATS VS HUMAN or MACHINE
