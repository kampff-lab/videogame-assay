# Tracking Calibration

There are currently two options being considered for tracking:

1. Color video with yellow stimulus over a red background.
2. Grayscale video with white stimulus over a gray background.

## Test Files

- __bayer-calibration.bonsai__: displays a simple green stimulus over a red background for white balance calibration.
- __camera-test-color.bonsai__: runs the contrast tracking processing pipeline for yellow/red setup.
- __camera-test-gray.bonsai__: runs the contrast tracking processing pipeline for white/gray setup.
- __camera-test-playback.bonsai__: runs the contrast tracking processing pipeline for a previously recorded video file for testing offline post-processing quality.
